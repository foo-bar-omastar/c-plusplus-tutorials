# C++ Tutorials

This repository contains code for various programs I wrote to get familiar with the C++ programming langauge.

## WORKING WITH TEXT AND BINARY FILES:

* **[Program 1](https://github.com/foo-bar-omastar/c-plusplus-tutorials/blob/master/Program_1.CPP):** Program in C++ to count and display the number of Lines starting with 'A' present in the file 'LINES.TXT’

* **[Program 2](https://github.com/foo-bar-omastar/c-plusplus-tutorials/blob/master/Program_2.CPP):** Assuming That a text file named FIRST.TXT contains some text written into it, A function vowelwords() that reads the file FIRST.TXT and creates a new file named SECOND.TXT to contain only those words from the first file which starts with a lower case vowel (i.e --> a,e,i,o,u)

* **[Program 3](https://github.com/foo-bar-omastar/c-plusplus-tutorials/blob/master/Program_3.CPP)**: Program to read the contents from the text file STORY.TXT, count and display the number of alphabets present in it

* **[Program 4](https://github.com/foo-bar-omastar/c-plusplus-tutorials/blob/master/Program_4.CPP)**: Program to print the count of the word “is” as acharacter in a file STORY.TXT

* **[Program 5](https://github.com/foo-bar-omastar/c-plusplus-tutorials/blob/master/Program_5.CPP)**: Program to print the count of the word “THE” as an independent word in a text file DIALOGUE.TXT

* **[Program 6](https://github.com/foo-bar-omastar/c-plusplus-tutorials/blob/master/Program_6.CPP)**: Program to count and display the number of lines not starting with the alphabet 'A' present in a text file "STORY.TXT". And to also count the number of blank present in this file.


* **[Program 7](https://github.com/foo-bar-omastar/c-plusplus-tutorials/blob/master/Program_7.CPP)**: Program to display the size of file "PARA.TXT" in bytes

* **[Program 8](https://github.com/foo-bar-omastar/c-plusplus-tutorials/blob/master/Program_8.CPP)**: To find the output of the file "data.dat" if it contains the string "ABC" before execution of the program....where " " are not a part of the file

* **[Program 9](https://github.com/foo-bar-omastar/c-plusplus-tutorials/blob/master/Program_9.CPP)**: To read the contents from the file GAME.DAT and creats a file BASKET.DAT where records of all playing basketball is stored

* **[Program 10](https://github.com/foo-bar-omastar/c-plusplus-tutorials/blob/master/Program_10.CPP)**: Program To Update the file with a new “no. of people” after the execution of the program

* **[Program 11](https://github.com/foo-bar-omastar/c-plusplus-tutorials/blob/master/Program_11.CPP)**: Program to read the contents of the file APPLY.DAT and display the details of Students

* **[Program 12](https://github.com/foo-bar-omastar/c-plusplus-tutorials/blob/master/Program_12.CPP)**: Program to search the file for the student details in the file on the basis of roll no. Supplied

* **[Program 13](https://github.com/foo-bar-omastar/c-plusplus-tutorials/blob/master/Program_13.CPP)**: Read and write Functions on a binary file STOCK.DAT

## ARRAYS:

* **[Program 14](https://github.com/foo-bar-omastar/c-plusplus-tutorials/blob/master/Program_14.CPP)**: Traversal of an array and printing values after multiplying by 3

* **[Program 15](https://github.com/foo-bar-omastar/c-plusplus-tutorials/blob/master/Program_15.CPP)**: Linear Search in 1-Dimensional Array

* **[Program 16](https://github.com/foo-bar-omastar/c-plusplus-tutorials/blob/master/Program_16.CPP)**: Binary Search In 1-Dimensional Array

* **[Program 17](https://github.com/foo-bar-omastar/c-plusplus-tutorials/blob/master/Program_17.CPP)**: Insertion In 1-Dimensional Array
