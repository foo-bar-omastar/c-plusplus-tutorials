# C++ Tutorials

This repository contains code for various programs I wrote to get familiar with the C++ programming langauge.

## WORKING WITH TEXT AND BINARY FILES:

* **[Program 1](https://github.com/foo-bar-omastar/c-plusplus-tutorials/blob/master/Program_1.CPP):** Program in C++ to count and display the number of Lines starting with 'A' present in the file 'LINES.TXT’

* **[Program 2](https://github.com/foo-bar-omastar/c-plusplus-tutorials/blob/master/Program_2.CPP):** Assuming That a text file named FIRST.TXT contains some text written into it, A function vowelwords() that reads the file FIRST.TXT and creates a new file named SECOND.TXT to contain only those words from the first file which starts with a lower case vowel (i.e --> a,e,i,o,u)

* **[Program 3](https://github.com/foo-bar-omastar/c-plusplus-tutorials/blob/master/Program_3.CPP)**: Program to read the contents from the text file STORY.TXT, count and display the number of alphabets present in it

* **[Program 4](https://github.com/foo-bar-omastar/c-plusplus-tutorials/blob/master/Program_4.CPP)**: Program to print the count of the word “is” as acharacter in a file STORY.TXT
